				administering Rally, using Rally, and exporting data from Rally.
			<li>Formally mentored two Project Managers in their transitions to ScrumMastering, assisted 
				several Cross-Application Project Managers moving into the consolidated portal project, and 
				helped two new Product Managers from Development and QA get up to speed with processes 
				and tools.

				Management Enterprises undergoing Agile Transformation.
			<li>Engage in the growth of my department’s offerings and processes, and my personal
